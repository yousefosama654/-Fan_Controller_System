# Fan_Controller_System

1. The aim of this project is to design a temperature-controlled fan using ATmega32
microcontroller, in which the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF according to the temperature. Use frequency 1Mhz.
2. In this project, the LM35 temperature sensor will give continuous analog output corresponding to the temperature sensed by it. This analog signal is given to the ADC, which converts the analog values to digital values.
3. The digital output of the ADC is equivalent to sensed analog voltage.
4. In order to get the temperature from the sensed analog voltage, we need to perform some calculations in the programming for the microcontroller.
5. Once the calculations are done by the microcontroller according to the logic, the temperature is displayed on the LCD.
